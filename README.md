# 🚀 Multi-Agent Loan Approval System

An AI-powered multi-agent loan approval and underwriting system built using **LangGraph**, **FastAPI**, **Streamlit**, **SQLite**, and **LLMs** to automate customer verification, sales consultation, underwriting evaluation, risk analysis, EMI calculation, and sanction letter generation.

This project simulates a real-world financial institution’s loan processing pipeline by using multiple specialized agents that collaborate to make explainable and structured lending decisions.

---

# 📌 Problem Statement

Traditional loan approval systems face several challenges:

- Manual verification is slow and inefficient
- Underwriting lacks consistency
- Risk evaluation is often delayed
- Sales qualification is disconnected from underwriting
- Decision transparency is poor

Banks and financial institutions need:

✔ Faster loan application processing  
✔ Automated applicant verification  
✔ Better underwriting consistency  
✔ Dynamic EMI calculation  
✔ Risk-based approval logic  
✔ Automated sanction letter generation  
✔ Centralized application storage  

This project solves these problems using a multi-agent architecture.
